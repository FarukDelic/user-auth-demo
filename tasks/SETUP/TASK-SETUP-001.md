# TASK-SETUP-001 - Initialize Database and Schema

## Context & Goal

**Business Value:** Establish the persistence layer for storing user data, enabling account creation.
**Epic:** SETUP
**User Story:** N/A

## Scope Definition

**✅ In Scope:**

- Create a SQLite database file (`main.db`).
- Implement a script to create the `users` table with the specified schema.
- Provide a reusable database connection utility.

**⛔ Out of Scope:**

- Seeding initial data.
- Database migration logic for schema changes.

## Technical Specifications

**Implementation Details:**

- Use the `sqlite3` npm package.
- The schema will include `id`, `email` (unique), `password_hash`, and `created_at`.
- The connection utility will be located at `src/lib/db.ts`.

**Architecture References:**

- TSD Section: 5. Data Model
- Technical Dependencies: `sqlite3`
- Data Flow: The application will use this module to perform all database operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the application is started
   **When** the database module is imported
   **Then** the `main.db` file is created if it does not exist.
2. **Given** the `main.db` file exists
   **When** the application starts
   **Then** the `users` table is created with the correct schema if it does not exist.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Implementation complete per technical specifications.
- [ ] `src/lib/db.ts` file created and functional.
- [ ] Code review completed and approved.
- [ ] Documentation updated if necessary.

## Dependencies

**Upstream Tasks:** None
**External Dependencies:** None
**Parallel Tasks:** Can be done in parallel with UI setup.
**Downstream Impact:** All API tasks depend on this.

## Estimation & Priority

**Effort Estimate:** 2 Story Points
**Priority:** P0
**Risk Level:** Low
