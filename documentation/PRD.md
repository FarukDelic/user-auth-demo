# Product Requirements Document: User Authentication and Dashboard

## 1. Executive Summary & Business Context

This document outlines the requirements for a foundational web application featuring user authentication (login and registration) and a simple dashboard. The primary goal is to establish a secure and scalable starting point for future feature development.

- **Problem Statement:** Users currently have no way to create accounts or access protected content, which is a prerequisite for any personalized or secure application functionality.
- **Business Objectives:**
  1.  Implement a complete user registration and login flow.
  2.  Provide a basic, protected dashboard area for authenticated users.
  3.  Create a reusable and collapsible navigation component for future scalability.
- **Target Personas:** The initial target is any new user who needs to create an account and access the application.
- **High-level Timeline:** The initial implementation is estimated to be completed within one development sprint (2 weeks).

## 2. User Research & Personas

- **Primary Persona:**
  - **Name:** Alex, the New User
  - **Motivation:** Wants to sign up and explore the application's features.
  - **Pain Points:** Cumbersome registration processes, unclear navigation.
- **User Stories:**
  - As a new user, I want to be able to register for an account so I can access the application.
  - As an existing user, I want to be able to log in to my account so I can access my dashboard.
  - As an unauthenticated user, I want to be redirected from the dashboard to the login page to protect private content.
  - As a logged-in user, I want to see a dashboard page so I can view the application's main content.
  - As a logged-in user, I want to be able to collapse and expand the navigation menu to maximize my screen space.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### Feature Group: Authentication

- **FR-001: User Registration**

  - **Requirement:** When a user provides a valid email and password on the registration page, the system shall create a new user account.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** a user is on the `/register` page.
    - **When** they enter a unique email, a strong password, and a matching confirmation password, and click "Register".
    - **Then** a new user account is created, and the user is redirected to the login page.
  - **Priority:** Must-have

- **FR-002: User Login**

  - **Requirement:** When a user provides valid credentials on the login page, the system shall authenticate the user and grant access to the dashboard.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** a user is on the `/login` page.
    - **When** they enter their correct email and password and click "Login".
    - **Then** the system verifies the credentials, establishes a session, and redirects the user to the `/dashboard` page.
  - **Priority:** Must-have

- **FR-003: Authentication Errors**

  - **Requirement:** The system shall display clear error messages for invalid registration or login attempts.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** a user attempts to register with an existing email.
    - **When** they submit the form.
    - **Then** an error message "Email already in use" is displayed.
    ***
    - **Given** a user attempts to log in with incorrect credentials.
    - **When** they submit the form.
    - **Then** an error message "Invalid email or password" is displayed.
  - **Priority:** Must-have

- **FR-004: Route Protection**
  - **Requirement:** The system shall prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected routes.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** a user is not logged in.
    - **When** they attempt to access the `/dashboard` URL directly.
    - **Then** they are redirected to the `/login` page.
  - **Priority:** Must-have

### Feature Group: Dashboard & Navigation

- **FR-005: Dashboard View**

  - **Requirement:** When an authenticated user navigates to the dashboard, the system shall display the main dashboard layout.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** a user is logged in.
    - **When** they access the `/dashboard` page.
    - **Then** the dashboard UI, including the collapsible navigation, is rendered. For now, the main content area will be empty.
  - **Priority:** Must-have

- **FR-006: Collapsible Navigation**
  - **Requirement:** The user shall be able to toggle the visibility of the side navigation menu.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - **Given** the dashboard page is open with the navigation visible.
    - **When** the user clicks the collapse/expand button.
    - **Then** the navigation menu collapses or expands, and the main content area resizes accordingly.
  - **Priority:** Must-have

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NF-001: Performance:** Page loads for login, register, and dashboard should be under 2 seconds.
- **NF-002: Usability:** Forms should be intuitive, with clear labels and validation feedback.
- **NF-003: Browser Support:** The application must be fully functional on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## 5. User Experience Specifications

- **Wireframes:** The UI will be based on the provided `Sign Up.png` image, featuring a clean, centered form.
- **Style:** Clean and modern, implemented using the `shadcn/ui` component library and Tailwind CSS.

## 6. Data & Integration Requirements

- **Data Models:** A simple `User` model containing `id`, `email`, and `password_hash`.
- **API:** Internal APIs will be created for `/api/register` and `/api/login`.

## 7. Technical Constraints & Assumptions

- **Technology Stack:** The project will be built using Next.js (App Router) and React.
- **Styling:** `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS will be used for styling.
- **Database:** A local `SQLite` database will be used for user data persistence.

## 8. Success Metrics & Analytics

- **KPIs:**
  - Successful user registrations per day.
  - Successful user logins per day.
- **Goal:** Achieve a 100% success rate for the core user flows (registration, login, dashboard access) in testing.

## 9. Launch & Rollout Strategy

- **Phase 1:** Implement all requirements outlined in this document.
- **Future Phases:** Will include features currently marked as out of scope, such as social login and password recovery.

## 10. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

- **Risk:** Using a local SQLite database may not be suitable for a large-scale production environment.
- **Mitigation:** This choice is suitable for the initial phase. The architecture will allow for migration to a more scalable database solution in the future if needed.
