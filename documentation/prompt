End-to-End Testing Plan for User Authentication and Order Management System
Introduction
USe MCP playwright to execute this task
This comprehensive testing plan is designed for a User Authentication and Order Management System built with Next.js. The plan covers the complete user journey from registration through order creation and management. The tests are structured to use Playwright for browser automation and should be executed sequentially to ensure proper data flow and dependencies.
Setup Requirements
Application URL: http://localhost:3000
Browser: Chromium (default)
Test Data: Dynamic test user emails with timestamp to avoid conflicts
Dependencies: Application server must be running before test execution
Cleanup: Each test suite should handle its own cleanup where necessary

Test Coverage Summary
This testing plan provides comprehensive coverage of:
User Registration: Form validation, successful account creation, error handling
User Authentication: Login process, credential validation, session establishment
Route Protection: Access control for protected pages
Dashboard Functionality: UI rendering, component interaction
Order Management: Creation, validation, display, and data persistence
Data Integrity: Calculations, persistence, state management
Session Management: Login state maintenance and logout process
Additional Considerations for QA Engineers
Technical Implementation Notes:
Use specific element IDs and data attributes for reliable element selection
Implement proper wait strategies for async operations (API calls, page loads)
Validate both visual elements and underlying data consistency
Test error scenarios and edge cases thoroughly
Ensure sequential execution with proper cleanup between tests
Key Selectors Reference:
Registration form: #register-email, #register-password, etc.
Login form: #login-email, #login-password
Create Order modal trigger button
Product and customer dropdown selectors
Address input fields with appropriate IDs
Order table rows and cells for data verification
Execution Strategy:
Tests should be run in sequence due to data dependencies
Use dynamic test data (timestamps) to avoid conflicts
Implement proper cleanup procedures
Capture screenshots at key verification points
Log detailed information for debugging failed tests
Success Criteria:
All test cases pass consistently
No data corruption or loss during normal operations
Proper error handling and user feedback
Responsive UI updates after all operations
Secure session management throughout user journey
