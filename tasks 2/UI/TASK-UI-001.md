# TASK-UI-001 - Build Authentication UI

## Context & Goal

**Business Value:** Provides the user interface for logging in and registering.
**Epic:** UI
**User Story:** As a new user, I want to be able to register for an account. As an existing user, I want to be able to log in.

## Scope Definition

**✅ In Scope:**

- Create a single page for authentication at `/auth`.
- Use tabs to switch between the Login and Register forms.
- Build the forms using `shadcn/ui` components (`Card`, `Input`, `Label`, `Button`, `Tabs`).
- Connect the form submissions to the respective API endpoints.
- Display error messages returned from the API.

**⛔ Out of Scope:**

- Social login buttons functionality.
- "Forgot password" functionality.

## Technical Specifications

**Implementation Details:**

- The component will be a client component (`'use client'`).
- State will be managed using `useState` for form inputs and messages.
- On successful login, the user will be redirected to `/dashboard`.
- The implementation will reside in `src/app/auth/page.tsx`.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a user navigates to `/auth`
   **When** the page loads
   **Then** the login and register tabs are displayed.
2. **Given** the user is on the register tab

   **Then** a request is sent to `/api/auth/register` and a message is shown.
3. **Given** the user is on the login tab
   **When** they fill the form and click "Login"
   **Then** a request is sent to `/api/auth/login` and they are redirected on success.
