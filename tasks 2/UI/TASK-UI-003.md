# TASK-UI-003 - Implement Collapsible Navigation

## Context & Goal

**Business Value:** Provides a scalable and space-saving navigation structure for the application.
**Epic:** UI
**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to be able to collapse and expand the navigation menu to maximize my screen space.

## Scope Definition

**✅ In Scope:**

- Create a reusable navigation component.
- The navigation should have a button to toggle its collapsed/expanded state.
- The state of the navigation (collapsed or expanded) should persist across page loads.
- The main content area should resize to accommodate the navigation's state.

**⛔ Out of Scope:**

- The actual navigation links (placeholders can be used).
- Complex animations for collapsing/expanding.

## Technical Specifications

**Implementation Details:**

- The component will be a client component.
- The collapsed state can be managed with `useState` and `localStorage` for persistence.
- The component will be part of the main layout for the dashboard.

**Architecture References:**

- TSD Section: 3. High-Level Architecture
- PRD Requirement: FR-006
- Technical Dependencies: `lucide-react` for icons.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a user is on the dashboard
   **When** they click the collapse button on the navigation
   **Then** the navigation menu collapses and the content area expands.
2. **Given** the navigation is collapsed
   **When** the user reloads the page
   **Then** the navigation remains collapsed.
3. **Given** the navigation is collapsed
   **When** the user clicks the expand button
   **Then** the navigation menu expands to its full width.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Navigation component created and integrated into the dashboard layout.
- [ ] Collapse/expand functionality is working correctly.
- [ ] The state is persisted in `localStorage`.
- [ ] Code review completed and approved.

## Dependencies
