# Dark/Light Mode Toggle Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a dark/light mode toggle button to the header navigation as requested in [Issue #1](https://github.com/FarukDelic/demo-user-auth/issues/1).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Theme Context (`src/lib/theme-context.tsx`)

- Manages global theme state (light/dark)
- Persists theme preference in localStorage
- Respects system preference as default
- Prevents hydration mismatch issues

### 2. Theme Toggle Button (`src/components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx`)

- Located in the header navigation (right side)
- Uses Lucide React icons (Sun/Moon)
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels

### 3. Navigation Updates (`src/components/ui/navigation.tsx`)

- Added theme toggle button to the right side
- Updated styling to support dark mode
- Enhanced button styles for better dark mode appearance

### 4. Layout Integration (`src/app/layout.tsx`)

- Wrapped the entire app with ThemeProvider
- Enables theme context throughout the application

### 5. Styling Support

- Uses Tailwind CSS dark mode classes
- CSS variables already configured for dark/light themes
- Responsive design maintained

## How It Works

1. **Theme Detection**: On first visit, the app detects the user's system preference
2. **Theme Toggle**: Click the sun/moon icon in the header to toggle between light and dark modes
3. **Persistence**: Theme preference is saved to localStorage and persists across sessions
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Icons and backgrounds transition smoothly between themes

## Technical Details

### Theme Context Features

- **State Management**: React Context for global theme state
- **Persistence**: localStorage for theme preference
- **SSR Safe**: Prevents hydration mismatch with proper mounting detection
- **System Integration**: Respects `prefers-color-scheme` media query

### CSS Classes Used

- `dark:` prefix for dark mode styles
- CSS variables for consistent theming
- Tailwind's built-in dark mode support

## Usage

The theme toggle works automatically once implemented. Users can:

1. Click the sun/moon icon in the header to toggle themes
2. The preference is automatically saved and restored on future visits
3. The system default is respected if no preference is set

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Visit the homepage
2. Look for the sun/moon icon in the header (right side)
3. Click to toggle between light and dark modes
4. Refresh the page to verify persistence
5. Test with different system preferences

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/theme-context.tsx` - New theme context provider
- `src/components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx` - New toggle button component
- `src/components/ui/navigation.tsx` - Updated to include toggle button
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added ThemeProvider wrapper
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Updated with dark mode background classes

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with CSS custom properties support
- localStorage support required for persistence
- Respects `prefers-color-scheme` media query where available
